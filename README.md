# Coding Sample for Predoc Application

This repository contains selected coding samples that demonstrate my proficiency in **Stata**, **R**, and **Python**.  
The included scripts come from real research workflows and are intended to showcase my ability to work with data cleaning, analysis, and automation across multiple programming environments.

## Repository Contents

- **`Stata_01_emission_analysis_main.do`**  
  Example of a structured and well-documented Stata `.do` file for event study analysis, including data preparation, estimation, and plotting routines.

- **`R_Compute_Distance_Firm&Monitor.R`**  
  R script demonstrating spatial computation and data manipulation, including distance calculations between firms and environmental monitoring stations.

- **`Python_MonitorID_Wind_matching.py`**  
  Python script illustrating data processing and geospatial nearest-neighbor matching using `pandas`, `numpy`, and `scikit-learn`.

## Purpose

These samples are provided for the **Predoc application** to allow reviewers to assess my coding style, technical skills, and ability to work with data across multiple programming languages.

## Contact
